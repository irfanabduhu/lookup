# Lookup: an information retrieval system

## Guidelines:
- Make separate file for each major blocks such as â€” multiple-user handling, lookup etc.
- Decompose the program into functions with single distinct functionality.
- Function should be named in lower case letters, separated by underscores(`_`), such as `add_user`.
- Interface of the functions should be concisely documented. Any presumption about input stream, exception handling should be mentioned in the documentation.

## Goal:
1. multiple users
