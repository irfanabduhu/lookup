Device
Waiting with my daughter for her dad, the concrete stoop burns.
Gabrielle plays with that crystal ball, her phone. “Do you have your bathing suit?” I ask.
Dan is taking her to Russian River. 
“Make sure she brings a bathing suit.” My husband for twelve years, now we converse in emails and imperative verbs. 
Still I smooth my ex’s way, sitting on steps whose cracks he never caulked.
There is so much to ask my immersed daughter. 
“Do you have your abacus?” 
She laughs, and I feel that sweet wash of charming, once more, a beloved in retreat.
