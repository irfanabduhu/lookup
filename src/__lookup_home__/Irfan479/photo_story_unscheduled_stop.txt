Photo Story: Unscheduled Stop
This was before the buses stopped running.
An article had come out saying cinnamon oil killed the virus and now people doused themselves.
The bus smelled happy, like a kitchen full of French toast.
A man a few seats up kept nodding, jerking awake, mask drooping.
The woman behind him screamed. “He’s got it!”

At the next station they made us wait while the transit marshal took him off.
Hands up, clasped together like he still knew how to pray.
It was dark by then.
The neon dog glowed a cold blue above the red shine of the bus depot.
